# CS:Low

This is CS-Low, a CS:GO config files repository. As an avid CS:GO player, I have spent a lot of time tweaking and customizing my gameplay settings to get the best possible performance.

## Getting Started

To use these files, simply download the repository and extract the contents to the current directories. [Currently working on a script to automate this process]

## Configurations Included

This repository contains a variety of different configuration files, including:
- Crosshair
- Video
- Sound
- Keybinds
- Autoexec.cfg
